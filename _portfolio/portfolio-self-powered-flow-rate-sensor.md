title: "Self-Powered Flow Rate Sensor"
excerpt: "The purpose of this project was to design a self-powered flow velocity sensor. The sensor is different from state-of-the-art implementations of flow rate sensing in that the mechanical design is not only smaller but also optimized for a larger range of flow velocity measurements. The sensor is also able to rectify input voltage signals, charge a battery, power an Arduino and have the ability to be calibrated easily. While this sensor is designed for civil applications (plumbing and piping systems), the mechanical design could be very easily altered to accommodate for flow sensing in water bodies (rivers, ocean currents, etc). <br/><br/><img src='/images/flow_sensor.jpg' style='max-width:400px;'>"
